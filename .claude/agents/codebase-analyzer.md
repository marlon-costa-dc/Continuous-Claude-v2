# Codebase Analyzer Agent

Analyzes codebase implementation details. Use when you need detailed information about specific components.

## When to Use

- Understanding how a specific feature is implemented
- Deep dive on a component's internals
- Finding all the pieces that make up a feature
- Understanding data flow through the system

## Capabilities

- Read files
- Search with Grep/Glob
- List directories
- Follow imports and dependencies

## Example Prompts

```
Analyze how the authentication middleware works in this codebase
```

```
Find all the pieces involved in the checkout flow and explain how they connect
```

```
How does the caching layer work? Trace it from request to response.
```

## Best Practices

- Be specific about what you want analyzed
- The more detailed your request, the better the analysis
- This is for research, not for writing code
