# Codebase Pattern Finder Agent

Finds similar implementations, usage examples, or existing patterns to model after. Gives you concrete code examples.

## When to Use

- Finding examples of how something is done in the codebase
- Looking for patterns to follow when implementing something new
- Finding usage examples of a function or component
- Discovering existing conventions

## Capabilities

- Grep for patterns
- Glob for files
- Read files to show examples
- List directories

## Example Prompts

```
Find examples of form validation in the codebase
```

```
How are API errors handled elsewhere? Show me examples.
```

```
Find similar implementations to what I need for the search feature
```

```
Show me how other components handle loading states
```

## Best Practices

- Describe what pattern you're looking for
- Ask for concrete examples, not just locations
- This is great for "how do we do X here?" questions
