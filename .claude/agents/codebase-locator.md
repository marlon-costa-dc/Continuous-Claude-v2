# Codebase Locator Agent

Locates files, directories, and components relevant to a feature or task. Like a super-powered Grep/Glob/LS.

## When to Use

- Finding where a feature lives in the codebase
- Locating all files related to a concept
- Finding entry points for a feature
- Mapping out what files you'll need to touch

## Capabilities

- Grep for patterns
- Glob for file patterns
- List directories
- Follow naming conventions

## Example Prompts

```
Find all files related to user authentication
```

```
Where does the API handle payment processing?
```

```
Locate the components involved in the dashboard
```

## Best Practices

- Describe what you're looking for in plain language
- Mention the feature or concept, not just file names
- Use this before codebase-analyzer for broad searches
